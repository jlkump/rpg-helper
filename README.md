A project meant to help organize the complexity of various tabletop RPGs, primarly Ars Magica. (However, Ars Magica is so complex, building for it ended up making a tool that could be used for many RPGs).

Provides tools for players to create characters in a setting given to them by a GM. The GM can edit existing settings to create their own worlds presented in a Wiki-like manner. Example shown below:
