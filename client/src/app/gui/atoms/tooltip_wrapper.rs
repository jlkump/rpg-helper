/// This html element is used to wrap another element that should have a tooltip.
/// When the element is hovered, it will create the given input html
/// at a location relative to the mouse position.
///
/// The tooltip has the option to "lock", which means that the user
/// can click or hover for a given length of time in order to keep
/// the tooltip stationary. With that, they can hover over elements
/// in the tooltip.
/// 
/// For mobile, simply clicking the element with the tooltip will
/// toggle the tooltip hover (whether it is lockable or not).
