/// This tooltip displays a wiki page preview while hovered over an element.
/// This will typically be used within a wiki page display while hovering
/// over links to other pages.
/// 
/// After hovering for a set amount of time, the page preview is "locked"
/// which allows for the user to scroll and inspect the hovered page.
/// 
/// On mobile, the user will just open the linked page.
