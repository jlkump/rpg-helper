// The editor for display provides a clean interface for creating
// the structure of a display page using the rpg-helper api for
// display.
// This allows a user to define a color-scheme for a given ruleset,
// game, or character, as well as how to display information on a character
// sheet. 

// Layout
// Title-bar header for edit settings
// A user can
// - Create a theme
// - Create a character sheet
// - Create a game-master view
// - Create a player view (a view for a game that is one of the tabs for the character sheet)

// Each display "sheet" has an option for an overide for the theme.
// A sheet defines a layout. The layout
// includes the "tabs" for the character sheet
// as well as what is displayed on that tab
// and what that.
