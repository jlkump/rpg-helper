/// Maps are a way for the user to interact with locations
/// in a more intuitive way.
/// Maps contain a collection of locations defined as either points on the map
/// or regions on the map.
/// The layer above this (the Wiki layer) defines the display image for a map,
/// here we define just the data we care about.
///     - Map name
///     - Dimensions of the map
///     - Set of locations (defined as either points or regions)
