// A rule-set defines all the meta-types, timeline events, locations, character types, modifiers, equations and wiki elements for a game. 
// These are made before a game is started by the GM (either by the GM or by using some pre-made rule-set)
// Anything defined in a rule-set can be overrridden by a setting

// Might be useful to have a trait for IDs?
