/// An ability is given to a character
/// It grants modifiers, can alter attributes, equations, conditionals, and state-tags
/// Some abilities have choices for targets or effects.
///     Some of these are chosen at character creation (and thus are templated abilities so no need to worry about that here)
///     Some of these are chosen while the game is active, allowing the player to pick from a range of tag types.
/// - Name
/// - Description
/// - Context (to layer atop character creation context)
